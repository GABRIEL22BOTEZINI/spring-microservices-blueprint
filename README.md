## üîç Overview

spring-microservices-blueprint is a Java Spring Boot microservices stack that helps you build and run multiple services quickly. It includes PostgreSQL, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Fluentd, JWT Auth, and Swagger. With this project, you can set up everything with just two commands.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To use this application, you need to have a few things installed on your computer. Here‚Äôs a quick list:

1. **Docker**: This software allows you to run applications in containers, ensuring that they work seamlessly in different environments.
2. **Docker Compose**: This tool helps you define and run multi-container Docker applications. It uses a simple YAML file to configure your application‚Äôs services.

Make sure you have the latest versions of Docker and Docker Compose. You can find installation instructions on their official websites.

## üì• Download & Install

To get started, you need to download the application.

### Steps to Download

1. Click the above link to go to the Releases page.
2. Look for the latest version of the application.
3. Download the suitable file for your operating system (usually a `.zip` or `.tar` file).

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Application

After downloading and extracting the files, you can run the application using the following simple steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

This command will start all the necessary services defined in the Docker Compose file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

The spring-microservices-blueprint comes with several features that make it easy to work with microservices:

- **PostgreSQL Support**: A robust relational database to store your data.
- **Kafka**: For handling real-time data feeds.
- **Elasticsearch**: To enable powerful search capabilities.
- **Kibana**: For visualizing your data.
- **Fluentd**: For log management.
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure user authentication.
- **Swagger**: For API documentation.

## üåê Accessing the Services

Once the application is running, you can access the various services through your web browser. Here are some default URLs for key services:

- **Kibana**: [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)
- **Swagger**: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

These links will let you visualize your logs and explore your APIs easily.

## üìÑ Documentation

Find detailed documentation for each of the components in the application. These documents go through setup, usage, and configuration options.

- **PostgreSQL**: Database setup and access.
- **Kafka**: Real-time messaging documentation.
- **Elasticsearch**: Search engine documentation.
- **Kibana**: Visualization guide.
- **JWT Auth**: Authentication procedures.
- **Swagger**: API documentation standards.

Refer to individuals' official documentation for deeper knowledge.

## üìù Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Docker not starting

If Docker fails to start, make sure it is running and properly configured. Check your Docker settings and ensure that your system meets the required specifications.

### Failed to connect to services

Confirm that your Docker containers are up and running. You can check via the command:

```bash
docker ps
```

This command lists all active containers. Make sure your services show up here.

### Access issues

If you cannot access Kibana or Swagger, verify that the services are correctly running. You can restart the containers using:

```bash
docker-compose restart
```
